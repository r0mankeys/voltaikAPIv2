## Description

This is the second version of the simple API that allows you to create, read, update and delete employees of a fake company name _Voltaik_. It is built with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.

You can only modify the employees data with my API key. I may change this functionality to allow users to create their own API keys in the future, storing them in a database
